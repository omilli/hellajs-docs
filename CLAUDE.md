    <documentation-principles>
      <progressive-disclosure>
        HellaJS documentation embodies progressive disclosure, practical utility, and conceptual clarity. Every piece of content should answer "why" before "how", demonstrate real-world applicability, and build from fundamental principles to advanced implementations.
      </progressive-disclosure>
      <dual-purpose-design>
        The documentation serves as both learning resource and definitive reference, balancing accessibility for newcomers with depth for experienced developers. Content must function effectively for casual browsing and deep study.
      </dual-purpose-design>
    </documentation-principles>
  </philosophy>
  <content-architecture>
    <learning-path-design>
      <structured-journey>
        Content flows through a carefully orchestrated learning journey: Quick-Start → Concepts → Tutorials → Reference → Plugins. Each stage builds foundation knowledge for the next, ensuring developers can engage at their comfort level while having clear paths to advancement.
